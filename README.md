# Identification-of-novel-LRRK2-inhibitors-by-SBVS-and-AFE-calculation
We calculated the relative binding free energy of LRRK2 inhibitors using alchemical simulations. Here, all the result files are displayed, showing the post-processing and analysis of the alchemical simulation trajectories using the pymbar program.
